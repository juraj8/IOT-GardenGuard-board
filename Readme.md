GardenGuard is an IOT type device created for collecting temperature data from multiple points in our garden. Main usecase for this data is to give alert for freezing weather in spring months, so user can take mitigation steps to prevent frost of the blooming fruit trees.

Freezing in spring months takes a lot of fruits from our garden. This is an attempt to hopefully get more fruits of our garden.
