GardenGuard is an IOT type device created for collecting temperature data from multiple points in our garden. Main usecase for this data is to give alert for freeazing weather in spring months, so user can take medigation steps to prevent frost of the blooming fruit trees.

Freezing in spring montgs takes a lot of fruits from our garden. This is an atempt to hopefully get more friuts of our garden.  

## Features
